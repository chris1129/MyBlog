	</p>

	<p>After all the hard work, I got my master degree of Computer Science & Engineering at University at Buffalo. </p>

	<p>The two years in UB was not an easy one. There were so many challenges that I've never met before. The first time to jump start my car, the first time to argue with DMV...etc. Not to mention the study was heavy for non English native speaker like me. But the most valuable thing I've learned here must be how to be lonely and happy. Back to the life in Taiwan, I was kind of a extrovert who always hanging out with friends. Now, I feel being an introvert gives me more time to explore myself without affecting by peers and this is sometimes an useful lifestyle.
	</p>

	<p>Studying in UB is an unforgetable experience in my life and it will last in my heart forever. Thanks to my parents' support and thanks to all the friends in buffalo. I can't achieve all of these without them. It's not the end, it's a begining of another journey. Big shout out for me!

	<p>It's the last day I was in Telenav as Intern. I tried to clean all the code up, write the report and say goodbye to every friends in Telenav. Before I checked out for my last day, me and my lunch buddies took a sweet picture at lobby.
	</p>

	<p>I can't describe how fast ten weeks passed. In Telenav, there were so many good colleage and friends who help me and taught me a lot. In here, my main task was Localization of Autonomous car which was a very fresh topic for me. I studied many different algorithms for localization and chose the most suitable one as solution for our case. The most interesting part was going out with other engineers for car testing because you wouldn't have an opportunity to be part of this if you are not in this industry. Working in Telenav is a big page in my life and it won't be forget.</p>
